🔍 URL Shortener

🚀 Overview

The URL Shortener is a simple web application that allows users to shorten long URLs, making them easier to share. 
The application is built using Python and Django, providing a user-friendly interface and robust backend functionalities.

🚀 Description

A URL shortener is a web application or service that converts long, unwieldy URLs into shorter, more manageable links. This process not only makes URLs easier to share, especially on platforms with character limits (like Twitter), but it also enhances the user experience by simplifying the appearance of links.

 🚀 How It Works

1. Input: Users enter a long URL they wish to shorten into a designated input field on the application’s interface.

2. Processing: The application generates a unique identifier for the long URL. This identifier is typically a random string of characters or a sequential number, which is appended to the service’s domain to create the shortened link.

3. Storage: The application stores the mapping of the shortened URL to the original long URL in a database, allowing for efficient retrieval later.

4. Redirection: When a user clicks on the shortened URL, the application looks up the corresponding long URL in its database and redirects the user to that address.

5. Tracking: Many URL shorteners also provide analytics features, enabling users to track the number of clicks.
